There is a few procedural generation methods:
- [SimpleRoomPlacement](#simpleroomplacement)
- [BinarySpacePartition](#binaryspacepartition)
- [CellularAutomata](#cellularautomata)
- [VoronoiNoise](#voronoinoise)

To use any of them, place the ProceduralGridGenerator script in your scene, and place either of these's scriptable objects inside it.
Its settings can then be modified from the inspector.
